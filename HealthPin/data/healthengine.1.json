        "s_description": "Serenity Acupuncture and Wellness is a wellness centre in Mernda, Victoria operated by Rachel Purcell.&nbsp;I am Rachel. I graduated from RMIT with a Bachelor of Applied Science from RMIT University in Chinese Medicine and Human Biology. In 2011 I had the opportunity to complete an internship at the Nanjing Jiangsu Provincial Hospital in China.&nbsp;I grew up with parents both in the health industry. My mum is a nurse working mostly in operating theatres, while my dad changed careers from being a medic in the Australian Army to becoming an acupuncturist and naturopath. This meant I grew up being treated by both allopathic and complementary therapy. When I finished high school, I chose to move to Melbourne to study Chinese Medicine.&nbsp;I enjoy treating a range of conditions, such as insomnia, irritable bowel syndrome, back and neck pain, arthritis, and have an interest in women&rsquo;s health (premenstrual tension, irregular periods, infertility, IVF support), auto-immune disorders such as fibromyalgia, and providing emotional support for those with anxiety and insomnia.&nbsp;My treatments aim at re-balancing the whole body, to give you an improved quality of life. To help regain this balance, I use a combination of Acupuncture, Chinese Herbal Medicine, Cupping, Gua Sha, Bowen Therapy, Moxibustion and Massage.&nbsp;Other health services available in the area include a general practitioner, pharmacy and dentist, and a little further out we have radiology and pathology services.&nbsp;As a private billing practice, we strive to provide the highest quality services for our patients. Practice fees include $85 for an initial consultation, $55 for a standard consultation, and if you are after more time we also offer standard 60 minute consultations for $75, and 90 minutes for $115.&nbsp;If traveling North on Plenty Road, turn right at the roundabout at the intersection of Plenty Road and Bridge Inn Road. Take the first left, then the clinic is located 450m on the right. There is parking available on site, and for those using public transport there is a bus stop nearby - Bridge Inn Rd/Schotters Road stop, then walk 350m. Our centre would be ideal for those in the areas of Doreen, South Morang, Wollert, Epping, Yarrambat, Plenty, Mill Park, Woodstock, Craigieburn, and Donnybrook.&nbsp;Booking an appointment is easy and can be done at any time using our convenient online booking service.

        "s_description": "We are a professional professional practice of Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, moxibustion, cupping, Chinese herbal medicine and Chinese massage.Acupuncture Many people experience a an acupuncture high after treatment. This is typically a pleasant, deeply relaxed, light headed or floating sensation. We encourage you to tell your practitioner how you feel during treatment, so to make the experience as pleasant as possible. Practitioners follow strict hygiene principals and only use single-use sterile needles.It's important to understand there is a difference between traditional acupuncture and a newer technique called \"dry needling\". Acupuncture should be practiced in it's traditional context, i.e. points are chosen according to the Chinese medicine diagnosis. Dry needling is based on Western medicine and there is no utilisation of Chinese medicine theory.Chinese Herbal Medicine We use concentrated granule herbs. The prescription is still made up individually, but in a powder-type from. The granules are very high potency of Chinese herbs. The manufacturing process involves the raw herbs being boiled up and the steam also captured. This is sprayed back into the herbs as they are drying into granule form. One teaspoon equals the typical one cup of boiling up herbs. Instead of drinking a cup of smelly liquid, you only have to take one teaspoon of granules. Although strong tasting, they are easier to drink than boiling up herbs and very convenient.Our herbs are all made up individually for each patient. You do need a prescription from a practitioner to get herbs from our clinic. We also offer a repeat prescription pick-up service. We can repeat any of your previous herbal formulas and can post them out or you can pick up without a consultation. You can now even order them from our online store.Tuina Chinese Massage Our one-hour session of Tuina includes a professional consultation with a TCM practitioner, the tuina massgae treatment (approx. 30 mins) and cupping therapy. The main difference between Tuina and other massage therapies is that it's done through the clothing, it usually is stronger thatn remedial massage, therefore shorter treatments are often used. Our tuina practitioners have Chinese hospital training.&nbsp;If you want to receive only Tuina massage, regular patients can book a 30 minute session which is massage only- no cupping.Fees:Acupuncture&nbsp;Initial $95Subsequent $75Chinese MassageOne-hour Treatment $75Half-hour Treatment $48",
